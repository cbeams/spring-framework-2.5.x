* added SimpleThreadPoolTaskExecutor for Quartz, allowing to define Quartz's default thread pool as Spring TaskExecutor
* added scheduling-style support for the JDK 1.5 ThreadPoolExecutor mechanism in the "java.util.concurrent" package
* added ConcurrentTaskExecutor adapter for accessing a JDK 1.5 Executor through the TaskExecutor interface
* added scheduling-style support for the CommonJ TimerManager API, as supported by WebLogic 9 and WebSphere 6
* added WorkManagerTaskExecutor adapter for accessing a CommonJ WorkManager through the TaskExecutor interface

Package org.springframework.samples
* upgraded JPetStore (standard and annotation version) to use the new XML schema namespaces "aop", "tx" and "jndi"

Package org.springframework.test
* added AbstractModelAndViewTests, a convenience super class for testing ModelAndView objects

Package org.springframework.transaction
* JtaTransactionManager only invokes rollback if transaction is still active (some JTA providers eagerly terminate)
* added TransactionNamespaceHandler to support dedicated "tx:*" XML tags

Package org.springframework.util
* added "isNull()" methods to Assert class
* added "setPathSeparator" method to AntPathMatcher, allowing to override the default path separator "/"
* fixed AntPathMatcher to correctly treat "*" right after separator, i.e. to accept path "/test/" for pattern "/test/*"
* WeakReferenceMonitor uses a daemon thread, to avoid a hanging thread even if weak references have not been released
* changed ConcurrencyThrottleSupport's default "concurrencyLimit" to -1 (keeping ConcurrencyThrottleInterceptor at 1)

Package org.springframework.web
* use NestedServletException wherever a root cause gets wrapped by a ServletException (for nicer root cause handling)
* WebApplicationContext interface does not extend ThemeSource anymore; implementing ThemeSource is now optional
* introduced ServletConfigAware interface, for getting access to a Framework/DispatcherServlet's ServletConfig object
* SimpleServletPostProcessor configures Servlets with DispatcherServlet's ServletConfig by default (can be turned off)
* introduced Handler interface as alternative to Controller, with no ModelAndView and only throwing Servlet/IOException
* AbstractCachingViewResolver guarantees at-most-once instantiation of each View instance (-> extended synchronization)
* added "currentFormObject" template method to AbstractFormController, for post-processing of a session form object
* "RequestContextUtils.getLocale(request)" falls back to the accept-header Locale if no LocaleResolver found
* FixedLocaleResolver returns the JVM's default Locale if no explicit default Locale specified
* VelocityView converts Velocity's MethodInvocationException to a Spring NestedServletException with original root cause
