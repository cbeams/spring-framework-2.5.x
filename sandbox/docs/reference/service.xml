        <para>There are still many Java applications that are not run inside a J2EE or Web container.  For such cases having a simple server lifecycle
        is useful for organizing the server implementation.  The JBoss application server is itself organized around such a principle, though is significantly
        more complex than the classes in this package.  The existing Spring configuration mechanisms do not apply when writing stand alone applications
        since there is no ordering to the creation and initialization of beans.

        The server package introduces a ServiceBean interface that contains intialize, start, stop, and
        destory lifecycle methods.  Classes that implement this interface can register with a ServiceManager using the normal Spring configuration mechanism.
        The ServiceManager is a composite ServiceBean.  Calling a lifecycle method on the ServiceManager will call the lifecycle method on all its
        registered ServiceBeans.  The order in which ServiceBeans are called is the order in which they are listed in the spring application configuration file.
