/**
 * Strategy interface for resolving a location pattern (for example,
 * an Ant-style path pattern) into Resource objects.
 *
 * <p>This is an extension to the base ResourceLoader interface.
 * A passed-in ResourceLoader (for example, an ApplicationContext passed in
 * via ResourceLoaderAware when running in a context) can be checked whether
 * it implements this extended interface too.
 *
 * <p>Can be used with any sort of location pattern (e.g. "/WEB-INF/*-context.xml"):
 * Input patterns have to match the strategy implementation. This interface just
 * specifies the conversion method rather than a specific pattern format.
 *
 * <p>This interface also suggests a new resource prefix "classpath*" for all
 * matching resources from the class path. Note that the resource location is
 * expected to be a path without placeholders in this case (e.g. "/beans.xml");
 * JAR files or classes directories can contain multiple files of the same name.
