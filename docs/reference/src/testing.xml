    <para>The Spring team considers developer testing to be an absolutely
    integral part of enterprise software development. A thorough treatment of
    testing in the enterprise is beyond the scope of this chapter; rather, the
    focus here is on the value-add that the adoption of the IoC principle can
    bring to <link linkend="unit-testing">unit testing</link> and on the
    benefits that the Spring Framework provides in <link
    linkend="integration-testing">integration testing</link>.</para>

    <title>Unit testing</title>

    <para>One of the main benefits of Dependency Injection is that your code
    should really depend far less on the container than in traditional J2EE
    development. The POJOs that comprise your application should be testable
    in JUnit or TestNG tests, with objects simply instantiated using the
    <literal>new</literal> operator, <emphasis>without Spring or any other
    container</emphasis>. You can use <link linkend="mock-objects">mock
    objects</link> (in conjunction with many other valuable testing
    techniques) to test your code in isolation. If you follow the architecture
    recommendations around Spring you will find that the resulting clean
    layering and componentization of your codebase will naturally facilitate
    <emphasis>easier</emphasis> unit testing. For example, you will be able to
    test service layer objects by stubbing or mocking DAO or Repository
    interfaces, without any need to access persistent data while running unit
    tests.</para>

    <para>True unit tests typically will run extremely quickly, as there is no
    runtime infrastructure to set up, whether application server, database,
    ORM tool, or whatever. Thus emphasizing true unit tests as part of your
    development methodology will boost your productivity. The upshot of this
    is that you often do not need this section of the testing chapter to help
    you write effective <emphasis>unit</emphasis> tests for your IoC-based
    applications. For certain unit testing scenarios, however, the Spring
    Framework provides the following mock objects and base support
    classes.</para>

        <para>The <literal>org.springframework.mock.jndi</literal> package
        contains an implementation of the JNDI SPI, which is useful for
        setting up a simple JNDI environment for test suites or stand-alone
        applications. If, for example, JDBC <classname>DataSource</classname>s
        get bound to the same JNDI names in test code as within a J2EE
        container, both application code and configuration can be reused in
        testing scenarios without modification.</para>

      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>It is important to be able to perform some integration testing
      without requiring deployment to your application server or connecting to
      other enterprise infrastructure. This will enable you to test things
      such as:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The correct wiring of your Spring IoC container
          contexts.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Data access using JDBC or an ORM tool. This would include such
          things as the correctness of SQL statements or Hibernate XML mapping
          files.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The Spring Framework provides first class support for integration
      testing in the form of the classes that are packaged in the <filename
      class="libraryfile">spring-mock.jar</filename> library. In this library,
      you will find the <literal>org.springframework.test</literal> package
      which contains valuable classes for integration testing using a Spring
      container, while at the same time not being reliant on an application
      server or other deployment environment. Such tests will be slower to run
      than unit tests but much faster to run than the equivalent Cactus tests
      or remote tests relying on deployment to an application server.</para>

      <para>Prior to the 2.1 release of the framework, Spring provided <link
      linkend="junit38-legacy-support">integration testing support specific to
      JUnit 3.8</link>. As of the 2.1 release, Spring offers support for unit
      and integration testing in the form of the <link
      linkend="testcontext-framework">Spring TestContext Framework</link>,
      which is agnostic of the actual testing framework in use, thus allowing
      instrumentation of tests in various environments including JUnit 3.8,
      JUnit 4.4, TestNG, etc. <emphasis>Note that the Spring TestContext
      Framework requires Java 5+.</emphasis></para>

      all new integration testing involving
      <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>s or requiring transactional

      <title>Common goals</title>

      <para>The Spring integration testing support frameworks share several
      common goals, including:</para>

          <para><link linkend="testing-ctx-management">Spring IoC container

          classes</link> that are really useful when writing integration
          tests.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The following sections outline each of these goals and provide
      direct links to information specific to the particular support
      frameworks.</para>

      <section id="testing-ctx-management">
        <title>Context management and caching</title>

        <para>Spring integration testing support frameworks provide consistent
        loading of Spring <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>s and
        caching of those contexts. Support for the caching of loaded contexts
        is important, because if you are working on a large project, startup
        time may become an issue - not because of the overhead of Spring
        itself, but because the objects instantiated by the Spring container
        will themselves take time to instantiate. For example, a project with
        50-100 Hibernate mapping files might take 10-20 seconds to load the
        mapping files, and incurring that cost before running every single
        test case in every single test fixture will lead to slower overall
        test runs that could reduce productivity.</para>

        <para>Test classes will generally provide an array containing the
        resource locations of XML configuration metadata - typically on the
        classpath - used to configure the application. This will be the same,
        or nearly the same, as the list of configuration locations specified
        in <literal>web.xml</literal> or other deployment
        configuration.</para>

        <para>By default, once loaded, the configuration file set will be
        reused for each test case. Thus the setup cost will be incurred only
        once (per test fixture), and subsequent test execution will be much
        faster. In the unlikely case that a test may 'dirty' the application
        context, requiring reloading - for example, by changing a bean
        definition or the state of an application object - Spring's testing
        support provides mechanisms to cause the test fixture to reload the
        configurations and rebuild the application context before executing
        the next test case.</para>

      <section id="testing-fixture-di">
        <title>Dependency Injection of test fixtures</title>

        <para>When Spring integration testing support frameworks load your
        application context, they can optionally configure instances of your
        test classes via Dependency Injection. This provides a convenient
        mechanism for setting up test fixtures using pre-configured beans from
        your application context. A strong benefit here is that you can reuse
        application contexts across various testing scenarios (e.g., for
        configuring Spring-managed object graphs, transactional proxies,
        <classname>DataSource</classname>s, etc.), thus avoiding the need to
        duplicate complex test fixture set up for individual test
        cases.</para>

        <para>As an example, consider the scenario where we have a class,
        <classname>HibernateTitleDao</classname>, that performs data access
        logic for say, the <classname>Title</classname> domain object. We want
        to write integration tests that test all of the following
        areas:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The Spring configuration: basically, is everything related

            mapped correctly and are the correct lazy-loading settings in

          <listitem>
            <para>The logic of the <classname>HibernateTitleDao</classname>:
            does the configured instance of this class perform as
            anticipated?</para>

      </section>

      <section id="testing-tx">
        <title>Transaction management</title>

        <para>One common issue in tests that access a real database is their
        affect on the state of the persistence store. Even when you're using a
        development database, changes to the state may affect future tests.
        Also, many operations - such as inserting to or modifying persistent
        data - cannot be performed (or verified) outside a transaction.</para>

        <para>The Spring integration testing support frameworks meet this
        need. By default, they create and roll back a transaction for each
        test. You simply write code that can assume the existence of a
        transaction. If you call transactionally proxied objects in your
        tests, they will behave correctly, according to their transactional
        semantics. In addition, if test methods delete the contents of
        selected tables while running within a transaction, the transaction
        will roll back by default, and the database will return to its state
        prior to execution of the test. Transactional support is provided to
        your test class via a
        <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> bean defined in the
        test's application context.</para>

        <para>If you want a transaction to commit - unusual, but occasionally
        useful when you want a particular test to populate or modify the
        database - the Spring integration testing support frameworks can be
        instructed to cause the transaction to commit instead of roll back
        either by calling an inherited hook-method or by declaring a specific
        annotation.</para>

        <para>The Spring integration testing support frameworks provide
        several <literal>abstract</literal> base test classes that can
        simplify writing integration tests. These base test classes provide
        well defined hooks into the testing framework as well as convenient

            testing application code that creates an object and persists it
            using an ORM tool, to verify that the data appears in the
            database. (Spring will ensure that the query runs in the scope of
            the same transaction.) You will need to tell your ORM tool to
            'flush' its changes for this to work correctly, for example using
            the <methodname>flush()</methodname> method on Hibernate's

      <title>JUnit 3.8 legacy support</title>

      <para>Spring's JUnit 3.8 legacy support is comprised of the classes
      found in the <literal>org.springframework.test</literal> package. This
      package provides valuable JUnit <classname>TestCase</classname>
      superclasses which can be extended for out-of-container integration
      tests involving Spring <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>s or
      requiring transactional support at the test method level.</para>

      <section id="junit38-legacy-ctx-management">
        <title>Context management and caching</title>

        <para><classname>AbstractSingleSpringContextTests</classname> provides
        context management and caching support for JUnit 3.8 based test cases
        and exposes a <literal>protected</literal> method that subclasses can
        override to provide the location of context definition files:</para>

        <programlisting>protected String[] getConfigLocations()</programlisting>

        <para>Implementations of this method must provide an array containing
        the resource locations of XML configuration metadata - typically on
        the classpath - used to configure the application. This will be the
        same, or nearly the same, as the list of configuration locations
        specified in <literal>web.xml</literal> or other deployment
        configuration. As an alternative you may choose to override one of the
        following. See the respective JavaDoc for further details.</para>

        <programlisting>protected String[] getConfigPaths()</programlisting>

        <programlisting>protected String getConfigPath()</programlisting>

        <para>By default, once loaded, the configuration file set will be
        reused for each test case. Thus the setup cost will be incurred only
        once (per test fixture), and subsequent test execution will be much
        faster. In the unlikely case that a test may 'dirty' the application
        context, requiring reloading - for example, by changing a bean
        definition or the state of an application object - you can call the
        <methodname>setDirty()</methodname> method on
        <classname>AbstractSingleSpringContextTests</classname> to cause the
        test fixture to reload the configurations and rebuild the application
        context before executing the next test case.</para>

        linkend="beans-factory-autowire"><emphasis>autowire by

        <para>Typically you will extend the subclass,
        <classname>AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests</classname>.
        This also requires that a <classname>DataSource</classname> bean
        definition - again, with any name - be present in the application
        context. It creates a <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> instance
        variable, that is useful for convenient querying, and provides handy
        methods to delete the contents of selected tables (remember that the
        transaction will roll back by default, so this is safe to do).</para>

        <para>If you want a transaction to commit - unusual, but occasionally
        useful when you want a particular test to populate the database - you
        can call the <methodname>setComplete()</methodname> method inherited
        from <classname>AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests</classname>.
        This will cause the transaction to commit instead of roll back.</para>

        <para>There is also the convenient ability to end a transaction before
        the test case ends, by calling the
        <methodname>endTransaction()</methodname> method. This will roll back
        the transaction by default and commit it only if
        <methodname>setComplete()</methodname> had previously been called.
        This functionality is useful if you want to test the behavior of
        'disconnected' data objects, such as Hibernate-mapped objects that
        will be used in a web or remoting tier outside a transaction. Often,
        lazy loading errors are discovered only through UI testing; if you
        call <methodname>endTransaction()</methodname> you can ensure correct
        operation of the UI through your JUnit test suite.</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The PetClinic application supports four data access technologies
        - JDBC, Hibernate, TopLink, and JPA. Thus the
        <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname> class does not itself
        specify the context locations - this is deferred to subclasses, which
        implement the necessary <literal>protected String
        getConfigPath()</literal> method from
        <classname>AbstractSingleSpringContextTests</classname>.</para>

        <para>For example, the Hibernate implementation of the PetClinic tests

        <programlisting>public class HibernateClinicTests extends AbstractClinicTests {

    protected String getConfigPath() {
        return "applicationContext-hibernate.xml";
    }
}</programlisting>

        <para>As the PetClinic is a very simple application, there is only one
        Spring configuration file. Of course, more complex applications will
        typically split up their Spring configuration across multiple files.
        Instead of being defined in a leaf class, config locations will often
        be specified in a common base class for all application-specific
        integration tests. Such a base class may also add useful instance
        variables - populated by Dependency Injection, naturally - such as a
        <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname>, in the case of an
        application using Hibernate.</para>

        <para>As far as possible, you should have exactly the same Spring
        configuration files in your integration tests as in the deployed
        environment. One likely point of difference concerns database
        connection pooling and transaction infrastructure. If you are
        deploying to a full-blown application server, you will probably use
        its connection pool (available through JNDI) and JTA implementation.
        Thus in production you will use a
        <classname>JndiObjectFactoryBean</classname> for the
        <classname>DataSource</classname> and
        <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>. JNDI and JTA will not be
        available in out-of-container integration tests, so you should use a
        combination like the Commons DBCP
        <classname>BasicDataSource</classname> and
        <classname>DataSourceTransactionManager</classname> or
        <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> for them. You can
        factor out this variant behavior into a single XML file, having the
        choice between application server and 'local' configuration separated
        from all other configuration, which will not vary between the test and
        production environments.</para>

      <section id="testcontext-ctx-management">
        <title>Context management and caching</title>

        <para>Each <classname>TestContext</classname> provides context
        management and caching support for the test instance it is responsible
        for. Test instances do not automatically receive access to the
        configured <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>; however, if a
        test class implements the
        <interfacename>ApplicationContextAware</interfacename> interface, a
        reference to the context will be supplied to the test instance via
        dependency injection (provided the
        <classname>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener</classname> has
        been configured). Note that
        <classname>AbstractJUnit38SpringContextTests</classname> and
        <classname>AbstractJUnit4SpringContextTests</classname> implement
        <interfacename>ApplicationContextAware</interfacename> and therefore
        provide this functionality out-of-the-box.</para>

        <para>In contrast to the JUnit 3.8 legacy support, test classes which
        use the TestContext framework do not need to override any
        <literal>protected</literal> instance methods to configure their
        application context. Rather, configuration is achieved merely by
        declaring the <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename>
        annotation at the class level. If your test class does not explicitly
        declare any application context resource <literal>locations</literal>,
        the configured <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> will
        determine how and whether or not to load a context from a default set
        of locations. For example,
        <classname>GenericXmlContextLoader</classname> -- which is the default
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> -- will generate a
        default location based on the name of the test class. If your class is
        named <literal>com.example.MyTest</literal>,
        <classname>GenericXmlContextLoader</classname> will load your
        application context from
        <literal>"classpath:/com/example/MyTest-context.xml"</literal>.</para>

        <programlisting>package com.example;

@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
<lineannotation>// ApplicationContext will be loaded from <literal>"classpath:/com/example/MyTest-context.xml"</literal></lineannotation>
<emphasis role="bold">@ContextConfiguration</emphasis>
public class MyTest {
    <lineannotation>// class body...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

        <para>If the default location does not suit your needs, you are free
        to explicitly configure the <literal>locations</literal> attribute of
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> (see code listing
        below) with an array containing the resource locations of XML
        configuration metadata (assuming an XML-capable
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> has been configured) -
        typically on the classpath - used to configure the application. This
        will be the same, or nearly the same, as the list of configuration
        locations specified in <literal>web.xml</literal> or other deployment
        configuration. As an alternative you may choose to implement and
        configure your own custom
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename>.</para>

        <programlisting>@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
<lineannotation>// ApplicationContext will be loaded from <literal>"/applicationContext.xml"</literal> and <literal>"/applicationContext-test.xml"</literal></lineannotation>

<emphasis role="bold">@ContextConfiguration(locations={"/applicationContext.xml", "/applicationContext-test.xml"})</emphasis>
public class MyTest {
    <lineannotation>// class body...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

        <para>By default, once loaded, the configuration file set will be
        reused for each test case. Thus the setup cost will be incurred only
        once (per test fixture), and subsequent test execution will be much
        faster. In the unlikely case that a test may 'dirty' the application
        context, requiring reloading - for example, by changing a bean
        definition or the state of an application object - you may annotate
        your test method with <interfacename>@DirtiesContext</interfacename>
        (assuming <classname>DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener</classname>
        has been configured, which is the default) to cause the test fixture
        to reload the configurations and rebuild the application context
        before executing the next test case.</para>

      <section id="testcontext-fixture-di">
        <title>Dependency Injection of test fixtures</title>

        <para>When you configure the
        <classname>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener</classname> --
        which is configured by default -- via the
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> annotation, the
        dependencies of your test instances will be
        <emphasis>injected</emphasis> from beans in the application context
        you configured via
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> by Setter
        Injection, Field Injection, or both, depending on which annotations
        you choose and whether you place them on setter methods or fields. For
        consistency with annotation support in Spring 2.1, you may choose
        either Spring's <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> annotation
        or the <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> annotation from JSR
        250. The semantics for both are consistent throughout the Spring
        Framework. For example, if you prefer <link
        linkend="beans-factory-autowire"> <emphasis>autowiring by
        type</emphasis> </link>, annotate your setter methods or fields with
        <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>. On the other hand, if you
        prefer to have your dependencies injected <emphasis>by
        name</emphasis>, annotate your setter methods or fields with
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>.</para>

        <para>Since <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> performs <link
        linkend="beans-factory-autowire"> <emphasis>autowiring by
        type</emphasis> </link>, if you have multiple bean definitions of the
        same type, you cannot rely on this approach for those particular
        beans. In that case, you can use
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> for injection <emphasis>by
        name</emphasis>. Alternatively, if your test class implements
        <classname>ApplicationContextAware</classname>, you can directly
        access the <classname>ApplicationContext</classname> supplied to your
        test and perform an explicit lookup using (for example) a call to
        <methodname>applicationContext.getBean("titleDao")</methodname>.</para>

        <para>If you don't want dependency injection applied to your test
        instances, simply don't annotate any fields or setter methods with
        <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> or
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>. Alternatively, you can
        disable dependency injection altogether by explicitly configuring your
        class with <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> and
        omitting
        <literal>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class</literal> from
        the list of listeners.</para>

        <para>Consider the scenario where we have a class,
        <classname>HibernateTitleDao</classname> (as outlined in the <link

        itself which uses <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> for field
        injection (we will look at the application context configuration after
        all sample code listings). <emphasis>Note: the dependency injection
        behavior in the following code listings is not in any way specific to
        JUnit 4.4. The same DI techniques can be used in conjunction with any

      <section id="testcontext-tx">
        <title>Transaction management</title>

        <para>In the TestContext framework, transactions are managed by the
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname>, which is
        configured via the
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> annotation by
        default, even if you do not explicitly declare
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> on your test
        class. To enable support for transactions, however, you must provide a
        <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> bean in the
        application context loaded via
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> semantics. In
        addition, you must declare
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> either at the class or
        method level.</para>

        <para>For class-level transaction configuration (i.e., setting the
        bean name for the transaction manager and the default rollback flag),
        see the <interfacename>@TransactionConfiguration</interfacename> entry
        in the <link linkend="testcontext-annotations">TestContext framework
        annotation support</link> section.</para>

        <para>There are several options for configuring transactions for
        individual test methods. If transactions are not enabled for the
        entire test class, methods may be explicitly annotated with
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>. Similarly, if
        transactions <emphasis>are</emphasis> enabled for the entire test
        class, methods may be explicitly flagged not to run within a
        transaction by annotating them with
        <interfacename>@NotTransactional</interfacename>. To control whether
        or not a transaction should commit for a particular test method, you
        may use the <interfacename>@Rollback</interfacename> annotation to
        override the class-level default rollback setting.</para>

        <para>You will occasionally find that you need to execute certain code
        before or after a transactional test method but outside the
        transactional context, for example to verify the initial database
        state prior to execution of your test or to verify expected
        transactional commit behavior after test execution (e.g., if the test
        was configured not to roll back the transaction).
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname> supports the
        <interfacename>@BeforeTransaction</interfacename> and
        <interfacename>@AfterTransaction</interfacename> annotations exactly
        for such scenarios. Simply annotate any <literal>public void</literal>
        method in your test class with one of these annotations, and the
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname> will ensure
        that your <emphasis>before transaction method</emphasis> or
        <emphasis>after transaction method</emphasis> is executed at the
        appropriate time. <emphasis>Note: any <emphasis>before
        methods</emphasis> (e.g., methods annotated with JUnit 4's @Before)
        and any <emphasis>after methods</emphasis> (e.g., methods annotated
        with JUnit 4's @After) will be executed <emphasis
        role="bold">within</emphasis> a transaction. In addition, methods
        annotated with <interfacename>@BeforeTransaction</interfacename> or
        <interfacename>@AfterTransaction</interfacename> will naturally not be
        executed for tests annotated with
        <interfacename>@NotTransactional</interfacename>.</emphasis></para>
