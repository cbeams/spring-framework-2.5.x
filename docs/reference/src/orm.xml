    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Spring provides integration with <emphasis>Hibernate, JDO, Oracle
    TopLink, Apache OJB</emphasis>, <emphasis>iBATIS SQL Map
    <emphasis>and</emphasis> JPA</emphasis>: in terms of resource management,
    DAO implementation support, and transaction strategies. For example for
    Hibernate, there is first-class support with lots of IoC convenience
    features, addressing many typical Hibernate integration issues. All of
    these support packages for O/R mappers comply with Spring's generic
    transaction and DAO exception hierarchies. There are usually two
    integration styles: either using Spring's DAO 'templates' or coding DAOs
    against plain Hibernate/JDO/TopLink/etc APIs. In both cases, DAOs can be
    configured through Dependency Injection and participate in Spring's
    resource and transaction management.</para>

    <para>Spring's adds significant support when using the O/R mapping layer
    of your choice to create data access applications. First of all, you
    should know that once you started using Spring's support for O/R mapping,
    you don't have to go all the way. No matter to what extent, you're invited
    to review and leverage the Spring approach, before deciding to take the
    effort and risk of building a similar infrastructure in-house. Much of the
    O/R mapping support, no matter what technology you're using may be used in
    a library style, as everything is designed as a set of reusable JavaBeans.
    Usage inside an ApplicationContext does provide additional benefits in
    terms of ease of configuration and deployment; as such, most examples in
    this section show configuration inside an ApplicationContext.</para>

    <para>Some of the the benefits of using Spring to create your O/R mapping
    DAOs include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Ease of testing.</emphasis> Spring's inversion of
        control approach makes it easy to swap the implementations and config
        locations of Hibernate SessionFactory instances, JDBC DataSources,
        transaction managers, and mapper object implementations (if needed).
        This makes it much easier to isolate and test each piece of
        persistence-related code in isolation.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Common data access exceptions.</emphasis>Spring can
        wrap exceptions from you O/R mapping tool of choice, converting them
        from proprietary (potentially checked) exceptions to a common runtime
        DataAccessException hierarchy. This allows you to handle most
        persistence exceptions, which are non-recoverable, only in the
        appropriate layers, without annoying boilerplate catches/throws, and
        exception declarations. You can still trap and handle exceptions
        anywhere you need to. Remember that JDBC exceptions (including DB
        specific dialects) are also converted to the same hierarchy, meaning
        that you can perform some operations with JDBC within a consistent
        programming model.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>General resource management.</emphasis> Spring
        application contexts can handle the location and configuration of
        Hibernate SessionFactory instances, JDBC DataSources, iBATIS SQL Maps
        configuration objects, and other related resources. This makes these
        values easy to manage and change. Spring offers efficient, easy and
        safe handling of persistence resources. For example: Related code
        using Hibernate generally needs to use the same Hibernate Session for
        efficiency and proper transaction handling. Spring makes it easy to
        transparently create and bind a Session to the current thread, either
        by using an explicit 'template' wrapper class at the Java code level
        or by exposing a current Session through the Hibernate SessionFactory
        (for DAOs based on plain Hibernate3 API). Thus Spring solves many of
        the issues that repeatedly arise from typical Hibernate usage, for any
        transaction environment (local or JTA).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Integrated transaction management.</emphasis> Spring
        allows you to wrap your O/R mapping code with either a declarative,
        AOP style method interceptor, or an explicit 'template' wrapper class
        at the Java code level. In either case, transaction semantics are
        handled for you, and proper transaction handling (rollback, etc) in
        case of exceptions is taken care of. As discussed below, you also get
        the benefit of being able to use and swap various transaction
        managers, without your Hibernate/JDO related code being affected: for
        example, between local transactions and JTA, with the same full
        services (such as declarative transactions) available in both
        scenarios. As an additional benefit, JDBC-related code can fully
        integrate transactionally with the code you use to do O/R mapping.
        This is useful for data access that's not suitable for O/R mapping,
        such as batch processing or streaming of BLOBs, which still needs to
        share common transactions with O/R mapping operations.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>To avoid vendor lock-in, and allow mix-and-match
        implementation strategies.</emphasis> While Hibernate is powerful,
        flexible, open source and free, it still uses a proprietary API.
        Furthermore one could argue that iBATIS is a bit lightweight, although
        it's excellent for use in application that don't require complex O/R
        mapping strategies. Given the choice, it's usually desirable to
        implement major application functionality using standard or abstracted
        APIs, in case you need to switch to another implementation for reasons
        of functionality, performance, or any other concerns. For example,
        Spring's abstraction of Hibernate transactions and exceptions, along
        with its IoC approach which allows you to easily swap in mapper/DAO
        objects implementing data access functionality, makes it easy to
        isolate all Hibernate-specific code in one area of your application,
        without sacrificing any of the power of Hibernate. Higher level
        service code dealing with the DAOs has no need to know anything about
        their implementation. This approach has the additional benefit of
        making it easy to intentionally implement data access with a
        mix-and-match approach (i.e. some data access performed using
        Hibernate, and some using JDBC, others using iBATIS) in a
        non-intrusive fashion, potentially providing great benefits in terms
        of continuing to use legacy code or leveraging the strength of each
        technology.</para>

    <para>The PetClinic sample in the Spring distribution offers alternative
    DAO implementations and application context configurations for JDBC,
    Hibernate, Oracle TopLink, and Apache OJB. PetClinic can therefore serve
    as working sample app that illustrates the use of Hibernate, TopLink and
    OJB in a Spring web application. It also leverages declarative transaction
    demarcation with different transaction strategies.</para>

    <para>The JPetStore sample illustrates the use of iBATIS SQL Maps in a
    Spring environment. It also features two web tier versions: one based on
    Spring Web MVC, one based on Struts.</para>

    <para>Beyond the samples shipped with Spring, there is a variety of
    Spring-based O/R mapping samples provided by specific vendors: for
    example, the JDO implementations JPOX (<ulink
    url="http://www.jpox.org"></ulink>) and Kodo (<ulink
    url="http://www.solarmetric.com"></ulink>).</para>

  <sect1 id="orm-hibernate">
    <title>Hibernate</title>

    <para>We will start with a coverage of Hibernate (<ulink
    url="http://www.hibernate.org"></ulink>) in a Spring environment, using it
    to demonstrate the approach that Spring takes towards integrating O/R
    mappers. This section will cover many issues in detail and show different
    variations of DAO implementations and transaction demarcations. Most of
    these patterns can be directly translated to all other supported O/R
    mapping tools. The following sections in this chapter will then cover the
    other O/R mappers, showing briefer examples there.</para>

    <para>The following discussion focuses on "classic" Hibernate: that is,
    Hibernate 2.1, which has been supported in Spring since its inception. All
    of this can be applied to Hibernate 3.0 as-is, using the analogous
    Hibernate 3 support package introduced in Spring 1.2 final:
    <literal>org.springframework.orm.hibernate3</literal>, mirroring
    <literal>org.springframework.orm.hibernate</literal> with analogous
    support classes for Hibernate 3. Furthermore, all references to the
    <literal>net.sf.hibernate</literal> package need to be replaced with
    <literal>org.hibernate</literal>, following the root package change in
    Hibernate 3. Simply adapt the package names (as used in the examples)
    accordingly.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Resource management</title>

      <para>Typical business applications are often cluttered with repetitive
      resource management code. Many projects try to invent their own
      solutions for this issue, sometimes sacrificing proper handling of
      failures for programming convenience. Spring advocates strikingly simple
      solutions for proper resource handling: Inversion of control via
      templating, i.e. infrastructure classes with callback interfaces, or
      applying AOP interceptors. The infrastructure cares for proper resource
      handling, and for appropriate conversion of specific API exceptions to
      an unchecked infrastructure exception hierarchy. Spring introduces a DAO
      exception hierarchy, applicable to any data access strategy. For direct
      JDBC, the <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> class mentioned in a
      previous section cares for connection handling, and for proper
      conversion of <classname>SQLException</classname> to the
      <classname>DataAccessException</classname> hierarchy, including
      translation of database-specific SQL error codes to meaningful exception
      classes. It supports both JTA and JDBC transactions, via respective
      Spring transaction managers.</para>

      <para>Spring also offers Hibernate and JDO support, consisting of a
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> /
      <classname>JdoTemplate</classname> analogous to
      <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname>, a
      <classname>HibernateInterceptor</classname> /
      <classname>JdoInterceptor</classname>, and a Hibernate / JDO transaction
      manager. The major goal is to allow for clear application layering, with
      any data access and transaction technology, and for loose coupling of
      application objects. No more business service dependencies on the data
      access or transaction strategy, no more hard-coded resource lookups, no
      more hard-to-replace singletons, no more custom service registries. One
      simple and consistent approach to wiring up application objects, keeping
      them as reusable and free from container dependencies as possible. All
      the individual data access features are usable on their own but
      integrate nicely with Spring's application context concept, providing
      XML-based configuration and cross-referencing of plain JavaBean
      instances that don't need to be Spring-aware. In a typical Spring app,
      many important objects are JavaBeans: data access templates, data access
      objects (that use the templates), transaction managers, business
      services (that use the data access objects and transaction managers),
      web view resolvers, web controllers (that use the business services),
      etc.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>SessionFactory setup in a Spring application context</title>

      <para>To avoid tying application objects to hard-coded resource lookups,
      Spring allows you to define resources like a JDBC DataSource or a
      Hibernate SessionFactory as beans in an application context. Application
      objects that need to access resources just receive references to such
      pre-defined instances via bean references (the DAO definition in the
      next section illustrates this). The following excerpt from an XML
      application context definition shows how to set up a JDBC
      <classname>DataSource</classname> and a Hibernate
      <classname>SessionFactory</classname> on top of it:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myDataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close"&gt;
    &lt;property name="driverClassName" value="org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="url" value="jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9001"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="username" value="sa"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="password" value=""/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="mySessionFactory" class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate.LocalSessionFactoryBean"&gt;
    &lt;property name="dataSource" ref="myDataSource"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="mappingResources"&gt;
      &lt;list&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;product.hbm.xml&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="hibernateProperties"&gt;
      &lt;props&gt;
        &lt;prop key="hibernate.dialect"&gt;net.sf.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect&lt;/prop&gt;
      &lt;/props&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

   ...
&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Note that switching from a local Jakarta Commons DBCP
      <classname>BasicDataSource</classname> to a JNDI-located
      <classname>DataSource</classname> (usually managed by the J2EE server)
      is just a matter of configuration:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myDataSource" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean"&gt;
    &lt;property name="jndiName" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/myds"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  ...
&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>You can also access a JNDI-located
      <classname>SessionFactory</classname>, using Spring's
      JndiObjectFactoryBean to retrieve and expose it. However, that's
      typically not necessary outside an EJB context. See the "container
      resources versus local resources" section for a discussion.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Inversion of Control: HibernateTemplate and
      HibernateCallback</title>

      <para>The basic programming model for templating looks as follows, for
      methods that can be part of any custom data access object or business
      service. There are no restrictions on the implementation of the
      surrounding object at all, it just needs to provide a Hibernate
      <classname>SessionFactory</classname>. It can get the latter from
      anywhere, but preferably as bean reference from a Spring application
      context - via a simple <literal>setSessionFactory</literal> bean
      property setter. The following snippets show a DAO definition in a
      Spring application context, referencing the above defined
      <classname>SessionFactory,</classname> and an example for a DAO method
      implementation.</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="mySessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
        this.sessionFactory = sessionFactory;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(final String category) throws DataAccessException {
        HibernateTemplate ht = new HibernateTemplate(this.sessionFactory);
        return (Collection) ht.execute(new HibernateCallback() {
            public Object doInHibernate(Session session) throws HibernateException {
                Query query = session.createQuery(
                    "from test.Product product where product.category=?");
                query.setString(0, category);
                return query.list();
            }
        });
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>A callback implementation can effectively be used for any
      Hibernate data access. <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> will
      ensure that <classname>Session</classname>s are properly opened and
      closed, and automatically participate in transactions. The template
      instances are thread-safe and reusable, they can thus be kept as
      instance variables of the surrounding class. For simple single step
      actions like a single find, load, saveOrUpdate, or delete call,
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> offers alternative convenience
      methods that can replace such one line callback implementations.
      Furthermore, Spring provides a convenient
      <classname>HibernateDaoSupport</classname> base class that provides a
      <literal>setSessionFactory</literal> method for receiving a
      <classname>SessionFactory</classname>, and
      <literal>getSessionFactory</literal> and
      <literal>getHibernateTemplate</literal> for use by subclasses. In
      combination, this allows for very simple DAO implementations for typical
      requirements:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">public class ProductDaoImpl extends HibernateDaoSupport implements ProductDao {

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) throws DataAccessException {
        return getHibernateTemplate().find(
            "from test.Product product where product.category=?", category);
    }
}</programlisting>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Implementing Spring-based DAOs without callbacks</title>

      <para>As alternative to using Spring's
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> to implement DAOs, data access
      code can also be written in a more traditional fashion, without wrapping
      the Hibernate access code in a callback, while still complying to
      Spring's generic <literal>DataAccessException</literal> hierarchy.
      Spring's <literal>HibernateDaoSupport</literal> base class offers
      methods to access the current transactional Session and to convert
      exceptions in such a scenario; similar methods are also available as
      static helpers on the <literal>SessionFactoryUtils</literal> class. Note
      that such code will usually pass "false" into
      <literal>getSession</literal>'s the "allowCreate" flag, to enforce
      running within a transaction (which avoids the need to close the
      returned Session, as it its lifecycle is managed by the
      transaction).</para>

      <para><programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">public class ProductDaoImpl extends HibernateDaoSupport implements ProductDao {

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category)
            throws DataAccessException, MyException {

        Session session = getSession(getSessionFactory(), false);
        try {
            List result = session.find(
                "from test.Product product where product.category=?",
                category, Hibernate.STRING);
            if (result == null) {
                throw new MyException("invalid search result");
            }
            return result;
        }
        catch (HibernateException ex) {
            throw convertHibernateAccessException(ex);
        }
    }
}</programlisting></para>

      <para>The major advantage of such direct Hibernate access code is that
      it allows any checked application exception to be thrown within the data
      access code, while <literal>HibernateTemplate</literal> is restricted to
      unchecked exceptions within the callback. Note that one can often defer
      the corresponding checks and the throwing of application exceptions to
      after the callback, which still allows working with
      <literal>HibernateTemplate</literal>. In general,
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname>'s convenience methods are
      simpler and more convenient for many scenarios.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Implementing DAOs based on plain Hibernate3 API</title>

      <para>Hibernate 3.0.1 introduced a feature called "contextual Sessions",
      where Hibernate itself manages one current Session per transaction. This
      is roughly equivalent to Spring's synchronization of one Hibernate
      Session per transaction. A corresponding DAO implementation looks like
      as follows, based on plain Hibernate API:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
        this.sessionFactory = sessionFactory;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
        return this.sessionFactory.getCurrentSession()
                .createQuery("from test.Product product where product.category=?")
                .setParameter(0, category)
                .list();
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>This Hibernate access style is very similar to what you will find
      in the Hibernate documentation and examples, except for holding the
      <literal>SessionFactory</literal> in an instance variable. We strongly
      recommend such an instance-based setup over the old-school static
      <literal>HibernateUtil</literal> class from Hibernate's CaveatEmptor
      sample application! (In general, do not keep any resources in static
      variables unless absolutely necessary!)</para>

      <para>Our DAO above follows the Dependency Injection pattern: It still
      fits nicely into a Spring application context, just like it would if
      coded against Spring's <literal>HibernateTemplate</literal>. Concretely,
      it uses Setter Injection; if desired, it could use Constructor Injection
      instead. Of course, such a DAO can also be set up in plain Java (for
      example, in unit tests): simply instantiate it and call
      <literal>setSessionFactory</literal> with the desired factory reference.
      As a Spring bean definition, it would look as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="mySessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main advantage of this DAO style is that it depends on
      Hibernate API only; no import of any Spring class is required. This is
      of course appealing from a non-invasiveness perspective, and might feel
      more natural to Hibernate developers.</para>

      <para>However, the DAO throws plain
      <literal>HibernateException</literal> (which is unchecked, so does not
      have to be declared or caught), which means that callers can only treat
      exceptions as generally fatal - unless they want to depend on
      Hibernate's own exception hierarchy. Catching specific causes such as an
      optimistic locking failure is not possible without tying the caller to
      the implementation strategy. This tradeoff might be acceptable to
      applications that are strongly Hibernate-based and/or do not need any
      special exception treatment.</para>

      <para>A further disadvantage of that DAO style is that Hibernate's
      <literal>getCurrentSession()</literal> feature just works within JTA
      transactions. It does not work with any other transaction strategy
      out-of-the-box, in particular not with local Hibernate
      transactions.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, Spring's <literal>LocalSessionFactoryBean</literal>
      supports Hibernate's
      <literal>SessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</literal> method for any
      Spring transaction strategy, returning the current Spring-managed
      transactional <literal>Session</literal> even with
      <literal>HibernateTransactionManager</literal>. Of course, the standard
      behavior of that method remains: returning the current
      <literal>Session</literal> associated with the ongoing JTA transaction,
      if any (no matter whether driven by Spring's
      <literal>JtaTransactionManager</literal>, by EJB CMT, or by plain
      JTA).</para>

      <para>In summary: DAOs can be implemented based on plain Hibernate3 API,
      while still being able to participate in Spring-managed transactions.
      This might in particular appeal to people already familar with
      Hibernate, feeling more natural to them. However, such DAOs will throw
      plain <literal>HibernateException</literal>; conversion to Spring's
      <literal>DataAccessException</literal> would have to happen explicitly
      (if desired).</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Programmatic transaction demarcation</title>

      <para>On top of such lower-level data access services, transactions can
      be demarcated in a higher level of the application, spanning any number
      of operations. There are no restrictions on the implementation of the
      surrounding business service here as well, it just needs a Spring
      <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname>. Again, the latter can
      come from anywhere, but preferably as bean reference via a
      <methodname>setTransactionManager</methodname> method - just like the
      <classname>productDAO</classname> should be set via a
      <methodname>setProductDao</methodname> method. The following snippets
      show a transaction manager and a business service definition in a Spring
      application context, and an example for a business method
      implementation.</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myTxManager" class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate.HibernateTransactionManager"&gt;
    &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="mySessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductService" class="product.ProductServiceImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="transactionManager" ref="myTxManager"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="productDao" ref="myProductDao"/&gt;

      <title>Transaction management strategies</title>

      <para>Both <classname>TransactionTemplate</classname> and
      <classname>TransactionInterceptor</classname> delegate the actual
      transaction handling to a
      <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> instance, which can be
      a <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> (for a single
      Hibernate SessionFactory, using a ThreadLocal Session under the hood) or
      a <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> (delegating to the JTA
      subsystem of the container) for Hibernate applications. You could even
      use a custom <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname>
      implementation. So switching from native Hibernate transaction
      management to JTA, i.e. when facing distributed transaction requirements
      for certain deployments of your application, is just a matter of
      configuration. Simply replace the Hibernate transaction manager with
      Spring's JTA transaction implementation. Both transaction demarcation
      and data access code will work without changes, as they just use the
      generic transaction management APIs.</para>

      <para>For distributed transactions across multiple Hibernate session
      factories, simply combine <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>
      as a transaction strategy with multiple
      <classname>LocalSessionFactoryBean</classname> definitions. Each of your
      DAOs then gets one specific SessionFactory reference passed into its
      respective bean property. If all underlying JDBC data sources are
      transactional container ones, a business service can demarcate
      transactions across any number of DAOs and any number of session
      factories without special regard, as long as it is using
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> as the strategy.</para>

      just accessing one database! HibernateTransactionManager will
      automatically expose the Hibernate transaction as JDBC transaction if
      the passed-in SessionFactory has been set up with a DataSource (through
      LocalSessionFactoryBean's "dataSource" property). Alternatively, the

      <title>Container resources versus local resources</title>

      <para>Spring's resource management allows for simple switching between a
      JNDI SessionFactory and a local one, same for a JNDI DataSource, without
      having to change a single line of application code. Whether to keep the
      resource definitions in the container or locally within the application,
      is mainly a matter of the transaction strategy being used. Compared to a
      Spring-defined local SessionFactory, a manually registered JNDI
      SessionFactory does not provide any benefits. Deploying a SessionFactory
      through Hibernate's JCA connector provides the added value of
      participating in the J2EE server's management infrastructure, but does
      not add actual value beyond that.</para>

      <para>An important benefit of Spring's transaction support is that it
      isn't bound to a container at all. Configured to any other strategy than
      JTA, it will work in a standalone or test environment too. Especially
      for the typical case of single-database transactions, this is a very
      lightweight and powerful alternative to JTA. When using local EJB
      Stateless Session Beans to drive transactions, you depend both on an EJB
      container and JTA - even if you just access a single database anyway,
      and just use SLSBs for declarative transactions via CMT. The alternative
      of using JTA programmatically requires a J2EE environment as well. JTA
      does not just involve container dependencies in terms of JTA itself and
      of JNDI DataSources. For non-Spring JTA-driven Hibernate transactions,
      you have to use the Hibernate JCA connector, or extra Hibernate
      transaction code with the TransactionManagerLookup being configured -
      for proper JVM-level caching.</para>

      <para>Spring-driven transactions can work with a locally defined
      Hibernate SessionFactory nicely, just like with a local JDBC DataSource
      - if accessing a single database, of course. Therefore you just have to
      fall back to Spring's JTA transaction strategy when actually facing
      distributed transaction requirements. Note that a JCA connector needs
      container-specific deployment steps, and obviously JCA support in the
      first place. This is far more hassle than deploying a simple web app
      with local resource definitions and Spring-driven transactions. And you
      often need the Enterprise Edition of your container, as e.g. WebLogic
      Express does not provide JCA. A Spring app with local resources and
      transactions spanning one single database will work in any J2EE web
      container (without JTA, JCA, or EJB) - like Tomcat, Resin, or even plain
      Jetty. Additionally, such a middle tier can be reused in desktop
      applications or test suites easily.</para>

      <para>All things considered: If you do not use EJB, stick with local
      SessionFactory setup and Spring's
      <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> or
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>. You will get all benefits
      including proper transactional JVM-level caching and distributed
      transactions, without any container deployment hassle. JNDI registration
      of a Hibernate SessionFactory via the JCA connector only adds value for
      use within EJBs.</para>

      is possible for spurious warning or exceptions to show up in the
      application server log. These warnings or exceptions will say something
      to the effect that the connection being accessed is no longer valid, or
      JDBC access is no longer valid, possibly because the transaction is no
      longer active. As an example, here is an actual exception from
      WebLogic:</para>

      <para>This warning is easy to resolve by simply making Hibernate aware

          and feeding it for example to Spring's

      <title>Implementing DAOs based on plain JDO API</title>

      <para>DAOs can also be written against plain JDO API, without any Spring
      dependencies, directly using an injected
      <literal>PersistenceManagerFactory</literal>. A corresponding DAO
      implementation looks like as follows:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private PersistenceManagerFactory persistenceManagerFactory;

    public void setPersistenceManagerFactory(PersistenceManagerFactory pmf) {
        this.persistenceManagerFactory = pmf;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
        PersistenceManager pm = this.persistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager();
        try {
            Query query = pm.newQuery(Product.class, "category = pCategory");
            query.declareParameters("String pCategory"); 
            return query.execute(category);
        }
        finally {
          pm.close();
        }
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>As the above DAO still follows the Dependency Injection pattern,
      it still fits nicely into a Spring application context, just like it
      would if coded against Spring's <literal>JdoTemplate</literal>:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="persistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmf"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main issue with such DAOs is that they always get a new
      <literal>PersistenceManager</literal> from the factory. To still access
      a Spring-managed transactional <literal>PersistenceManager</literal>,
      consider defining a
      <literal>TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy</literal> (as
      included in Spring) in front of your target
      <literal>PersistenceManagerFactory</literal>, passing the proxy into
      your DAOs.</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myPmfProxy"
      class="org.springframework.orm.jdo.TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy"&gt;
    &lt;property name="targetPersistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmf"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="persistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmfProxy"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  ...
&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Your data access code will then receive a transactional
      <literal>PersistenceManager</literal> (if any) from the
      <literal>PersistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager()</literal>
      method that it calls. The latter method call goes through the proxy,
      which will first check for a current transactional
      <literal>PersistenceManager</literal> before getting a new one from the
      factory. <literal>close</literal> calls on the
      <literal>PersistenceManager</literal> will be ignored in case of a
      transaction <literal>PersistenceManager</literal>.</para>

      <para>If your data access code will always run within an active
      transaction (or at least within active transaction synchronization), it
      is safe to omit the <literal>PersistenceManager.close()</literal> call
      and thus the entire <literal>finally</literal> block, which you might
      prefer to keep your DAO implementations concise:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private PersistenceManagerFactory persistenceManagerFactory;

    public void setPersistenceManagerFactory(PersistenceManagerFactory pmf) {
        this.persistenceManagerFactory = pmf;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
        PersistenceManager pm = this.persistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager();
        Query query = pm.newQuery(Product.class, "category = pCategory");
        query.declareParameters("String pCategory"); 
        return query.execute(category);
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>With such DAOs that rely on active transactions, it is recommended
      to enforce active transactions through turning
      <literal>TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy</literal>'s
      "allowCreate" flag off:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myPmfProxy"
      class="org.springframework.orm.jdo.TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy"&gt;
    &lt;property name="targetPersistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmf"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="allowCreate" value="false"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="persistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmfProxy"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  ...
&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main advantage of this DAO style is that it depends on JDO API
      only; no import of any Spring class is required. This is of course
      appealing from a non-invasiveness perspective, and might feel more
      natural to JDO developers.</para>

      <para>However, the DAO throws plain <literal>JDOException</literal>
      (which is unchecked, so does not have to be declared or caught), which
      means that callers can only treat exceptions as generally fatal - unless
      they want to depend on JDO's own exception structure. Catching specific
      causes such as an optimistic locking failure is not possible without
      tying the caller to the implementation strategy. This tradeoff might be
      acceptable to applications that are strongly JDO-based and/or do not
      need any special exception treatment.</para>

      <para>In summary: DAOs can be implemented based on plain JDO API, while
      still being able to participate in Spring-managed transactions. This
      might in particular appeal to people already familar with JDO, feeling
      more natural to them. However, such DAOs will throw plain
      <literal>JDOException</literal>; conversion to Spring's
      <literal>DataAccessException</literal> would have to happen explicitly
      (if desired).</para>

      <title>Transaction management</title>

      <para>To execute service operations within transactions, you can use
      Spring's common declarative transaction facilities. For example, you
      could define a <literal>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</literal> for a
      ProductService, which in turn delegates to the JDO-based ProductDao.
      Each specified method would then automatically get executed within a
      transaction, with all affected DAO operations automatically
      participating in it.</para>

      <para><programlisting format="linespecific" xml:space="preserve">&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myTxManager" class="org.springframework.orm.jdo.JdoTransactionManager"&gt;

  &lt;/bean&gt;

      &lt;/props&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting></para>

      <para>Note that JDO requires an active transaction when modifying a
      persistent object. There is no concept like a non-transactional flush in
      JDO, in contrast to Hibernate. For this reason, the chosen JDO
      implementation needs to be set up for a specific environment: in
      particular, it needs to be explicitly set up for JTA synchronization, to
      detect an active JTA transaction itself. This is not necessary for local
      transactions as performed by Spring's
      <literal>JdoTransactionManager</literal>, but it is necessary for
      participating in JTA transactions (whether driven by Spring's
      <literal>JtaTransactionManager</literal> or by EJB CMT / plain
      JTA).</para>

      <para><literal>JdoTransactionManager</literal> is capable of exposing a
      JDO transaction to JDBC access code that accesses the same JDBC
      <literal>DataSource</literal>, provided that the registered
      <literal>JdoDialect</literal> supports retrieval of the underlying JDBC
      <literal>Connection</literal>. This is by default the case for
      JDBC-based JDO 2.0 implementations; for JDO 1.0 implementations, a
      custom <literal>JdoDialect</literal> needs to be used. See next section
      for details on the <literal>JdoDialect</literal> mechanism.</para>

      <title>JdoDialect</title>

      <para>As an advanced feature, both <literal>JdoTemplate</literal> and
      <literal>JdoTransactionManager</literal> support a custom
      <literal>JdoDialect</literal>, to be passed into the "jdoDialect" bean
      property. In such a scenario, the DAOs won't receive a
      <literal>PersistenceManagerFactory</literal> reference but rather a full
      <literal>JdoTemplate</literal> instance instead (for example, passed
      into <literal>JdoDaoSupport</literal>'s "jdoTemplate" property). A
      <literal>JdoDialect</literal> implementation can enable some advanced
      features supported by Spring, usually in a vendor-specific
      manner:</para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This is particularly valuable for JDO 1.0 implementations, where
      none of those features are covered by the standard API. On JDO 2.0, most
      of those features are supported in a standard manner: Hence, Spring's
      <literal>DefaultJdoDialect</literal> uses the corresponding JDO 2.0 API
      methods by default (as of Spring 1.2). For special transaction semantics
      and for advanced translation of exception, it is still valuable to
      derive vendor-specific <literal>JdoDialect</literal> subclasses.</para>

      its operations and how they are used within Spring's JDO support.</para>

      <para>As the above DAO still follows the Dependency Injection pattern,
      it still fits nicely into a Spring application context, analogous to
      like it would if coded against Spring's
      <literal>TopLinkTemplate</literal>. Spring's
      <literal>TransactionAwareSessionAdapter</literal> is used to expose a
      bean reference of type <literal>Session</literal>, to be passed into the
      DAO:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="mySessionAdapter"
      class="org.springframework.orm.toplink.support.TransactionAwareSessionAdapter"&gt;
    &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="mySessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="session" ref="mySessionAdapter"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  ...
&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main advantage of this DAO style is that it depends on TopLink
      API only; no import of any Spring class is required. This is of course
      appealing from a non-invasiveness perspective, and might feel more
      natural to TopLink developers.</para>

      <para>However, the DAO throws plain <literal>TopLinkException</literal>
      (which is unchecked, so does not have to be declared or caught), which
      means that callers can only treat exceptions as generally fatal - unless
      they want to depend on TopLink's own exception structure. Catching
      specific causes such as an optimistic locking failure is not possible
      without tying the caller to the implementation strategy. This tradeoff
      might be acceptable to applications that are strongly TopLink-based
      and/or do not need any special exception treatment.</para>

      <para>A further disadvantage of that DAO style is that TopLink's
      standard <literal>getActiveSession()</literal> feature just works within
      JTA transactions. It does not work with any other transaction strategy
      out-of-the-box, in particular not with local TopLink
      transactions.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, Spring's
      <literal>TransactionAwareSessionAdapter</literal> exposes a
      corresponding proxy for the TopLink <literal>ServerSession</literal>
      which supports TopLink's <literal>Session.getActiveSession()</literal>
      and <literal>Session.getActiveUnitOfWork()</literal> methods for any
      Spring transaction strategy, returning the current Spring-managed
      transactional <literal>Session</literal> even with
      <literal>TopLinkTransactionManager</literal>. Of course, the standard
      behavior of that method remains: returning the current
      <literal>Session</literal> associated with the ongoing JTA transaction,
      if any (no matter whether driven by Spring's
      <literal>JtaTransactionManager</literal>, by EJB CMT, or by plain
      JTA).</para>

      <para>In summary: DAOs can be implemented based on plain TopLink API,
      while still being able to participate in Spring-managed transactions.
      This might in particular appeal to people already familar with TopLink,
      feeling more natural to them. However, such DAOs will throw plain
      <literal>TopLinkException</literal>; conversion to Spring's
      <literal>DataAccessException</literal> would have to happen explicitly
      (if desired).</para>

      <title>Transaction management</title>

      <para>To execute service operations within transactions, you can use
      Spring's common declarative transaction facilities. For example, you
      could define a <literal>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</literal> for a
      ProductService, which in turn delegates to the TopLink-based ProductDao.
      Each specified method would then automatically get executed within a
      transaction, with all affected DAO operations automatically
      participating in it.</para>

      <para>Note that TopLink requires an active <literal>UnitOfWork</literal>
      for modifying a persistent object. (You should never modify objects
      returned by a plain TopLink <literal>Session</literal> - those are
      usually read-only objects, directly taken from the second-level cache!)
      There is no concept like a non-transactional flush in TopLink, in
      contrast to Hibernate. For this reason, TopLink needs to be set up for a
      specific environment: in particular, it needs to be explicitly set up
      for JTA synchronization, to detect an active JTA transaction itself and
      expose a corresponding active <literal>Session</literal> and
      <literal>UnitOfWork</literal>. This is not necessary for local
      transactions as performed by Spring's
      <literal>TopLinkTransactionManager</literal>, but it is necessary for
      participating in JTA transactions (whether driven by Spring's
      <literal>JtaTransactionManager</literal> or by EJB CMT / plain
      JTA).</para>

      <para>Within your TopLink-based DAO code, use the
      <literal>Session.getActiveUnitOfWork()</literal> method to access the
      current <literal>UnitOfWork</literal> and perform write operations
      through it. This will only work within an active transaction (both
      within Spring-managed transactions and plain JTA transactions). For
      special needs, you can also acquire separate
      <literal>UnitOfWork</literal> instances that won't participate in the
      current transaction; this is hardly needed, though.</para>

      <para><literal>TopLinkTransactionManager</literal> is capable of
      exposing a TopLink transaction to JDBC access code that accesses the
      same JDBC <literal>DataSource</literal>, provided that TopLink works
      with JDBC in the backend and is thus able to expose the underlying JDBC
      <literal>Connection</literal>. The <literal>DataSource</literal> to
      expose the transactions for needs to be specified explicitly; it won't
      be autodetected.</para>

    <para>Apache OJB (<ulink url="http://db.apache.org/ojb"></ulink>) offers
    multiple API levels, such as ODMG and JDO. Aside from supporting OJB
    through JDO, Spring also supports OJB's lowe-level PersistenceBroker API
    as data access strategy. The corresponding integration classes reside in
    the <literal>org.springframework.orm.ojb</literal> package.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>OJB setup in a Spring environment</title>

      <para>In contrast to Hibernate or JDO, OJB does not follow a factory

      <para>In addition to supporting OJB's default initialization style,
      Spring also provides a <classname>Local</classname>OjbConfigurer class

      instances are referenced in the OJB repository descriptor (the mapping

      <para>A callback implementation can effectively be used for any OJB data
      access. <classname>PersistenceBrokerTemplate</classname> will ensure
      that <classname>PersistenceBroker</classname>s are properly opened and
      closed, and automatically participate in transactions. The template
      instances are thread-safe and reusable, they can thus be kept as
      instance variables of the surrounding class. For simple single-step

      <literal>getObjectByQuery</literal>, <literal>store</literal>, or
      <literal>delete</literal> call,
      <classname>PersistenceBrokerTemplate</classname> offers alternative
      convenience methods that can replace such one line callback
      implementations. Furthermore, Spring provides a convenient
      <classname>PersistenceBrokerDaoSupport</classname> base class that
      provides a <literal>setJcdAlias</literal> method for receiving an OJB
      JCD alias, and <literal>getPersistenceBrokerTemplate</literal> for use
      by subclasses. In combination, this allows for very simple DAO
      implementations for typical requirements:</para>

      <para>As alternative to working with Spring's

      access code is able to throw checked exceptions.
      <literal>PersistenceBrokerDaoSupport</literal> offers a variety of

        <para>The <literal>SqlMapClientDaoSupport</literal> class offers a
        supporting class similar to the <literal>SqlMapDaoSupport</literal>.
        We extend it to implement our DAO: <programlisting>public class SqlMapAccountDao extends SqlMapClientDaoSupport implements AccountDao {

    public Account getAccount(String email) throws DataAccessException {
        return (Account) getSqlMapClientTemplate().queryForObject("getAccountByEmail", email);
    }

    public void insertAccount(Account account) throws DataAccessException {
        getSqlMapClientTemplate().update("insertAccount", account);
    }
}</programlisting>In the DAO, we use the pre-configured
        <literal>SqlMapClientTemplate</literal> to execute the queries, after
        setting up the <literal>SqlMapAccountDao</literal> in the application
        context and wiring it with our <literal>SqlMapClient</literal>
        instance: <programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="accountDao" class="example.SqlMapAccountDao"&gt;
    &lt;property name="sqlMapClient" ref="sqlMapClient"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting></para>

        <para>Note that a <literal>SqlMapTemplate</literal> instance could
        also be created manually, passing in the
        <literal>SqlMapClient</literal> as constructor argument. The
        <literal>SqlMapClientDaoSupport</literal> base class simply
        pre-initializes a <literal>SqlMapClientTemplate</literal> instance for
        us.</para>

        <para>The <literal>SqlMapClientTemplate</literal> also offers a
        generic <literal>execute</literal> method, taking a custom
        <literal>SqlMapClientCallback</literal> implementation as argument.
        This can, for example, be used for batching: <programlisting>public class SqlMapAccountDao extends SqlMapClientDaoSupport implements AccountDao {
    ...

    public void insertAccount(Account account) throws DataAccessException {
        getSqlMapClientTemplate().execute(new SqlMapClientCallback() {

                executor.startBatch();
                executor.update("insertAccount", account);
                executor.update("insertAddress", account.getAddress());
                executor.executeBatch();
            }
        });
    }
}</programlisting>In general, any combination of operations offered by the
        native <literal>SqlMapExecutor</literal> API can be used in such a
        callback. Any <literal>SQLException</literal> thrown will
        automatically get converted to Spring's generic
        <literal>DataAccessException</literal> hierarchy.</para>

        <title>Implementing DAOs based on plain iBATIS API</title>

        <para>DAOs can also be written against plain iBATIS API, without any
        Spring dependencies, directly using an injected
        <literal>SqlMapClient</literal>. A corresponding DAO implementation
        looks like as follows:<programlisting>public class SqlMapAccountDao implements AccountDao {
        
    private SqlMapClient sqlMapClient;
    
    public void setSqlMapClient(SqlMapClient sqlMapClient) {
        this.sqlMapClient = sqlMapClient;
    }

    public Account getAccount(String email) {
        try {
            return (Account) this.sqlMapClient.queryForObject("getAccountByEmail", email);
        }
        catch (SQLException ex) {
            throw new MyDaoException(ex);
        }
    }

    public void insertAccount(Account account) throws DataAccessException {
        try {
            this.sqlMapClient.update("insertAccount", account);
        }
        catch (SQLException ex) {
            throw new MyDaoException(ex);
        }
    }
}</programlisting>In such a scenario, the <literal>SQLException</literal>
        thrown by the iBATIS API needs to be handled in a custom fashion:
        usually, wrapping it in your own application-specific DAO exception.
        Wiring in the application context would still look like before, due to
        the fact that the plain iBATIS-based DAO still follows the Dependency
        Injection pattern: <programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="accountDao" class="example.SqlMapAccountDao"&gt;

        <para>which, as the name implies, creates a

        solely use JPA for data access. The factory bean will use JPA
        <literal><literal>PersistenceProvider</literal></literal>
        autodetection mechanism and in most cases, requires only the
        persistence unit name:</para>

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>Switching to a JNDI
        <literal>EntityManagerFactory</literal> (for example in JTA

        strategy and the <literal>loadTimeWeaver</literal>. It is thus

        the weaving process.</para>

      <title>JpaTemplate and JpaDaoSupport</title>

      <para>Each JPA-based DAO will then receive a
      <literal>EntityManagerFactory</literal> through dependency injection,
      i.e. through setter or construction injection. Such a DAO can be coded
      against plain JPA and work with the given <literal>EntityManagerFactory
      </literal>or rather through Spring's
      <literal>JpaTemplate</literal>:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
...
  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="entityManagerFactory" ref="entityManagerFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;
...
&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting><programlisting>public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {
  
    private EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory;

    public void setEntityManagerFactory(EntityManagerFactory emf) {
        this.entityManagerFactoryeManagerFactory = emf;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(final String category) throws DataAccessException {
        JpaTemplate jpaTemplate = new JpaTemplate(this.entityManagerFactory);
        return (Collection) jpaTemplate.execute(new JpaCallback() {
            public Object doInJpa(EntityManager em) throws PersistenceException {
                Query query = em.createQuery("from Product");
                List result = query.execute(category);
                // do some further stuff with the result list
                return result;
            }
        });
    }
}</programlisting>The JpaCallback implementation allows any type of JPA data
      access. The JpaTemplate will ensure that EntityManagers are properly
      opened and closed and automatically participate in transactions.
      Moreover, the JpaTemplate properly handles exceptions, making sure
      resources are cleaned up and the approapriate transactions rolled back.
      The template instances are thread-safe and reusable and they can be kept
      as instance variable of the enclosing class. Note that JpaTemplate
      offers single-step actions such as find, load, merge, etc along with
      alternative convenience methods that can replace one line callback
      implementations.</para>

      <para>Furthermore, Spring provides a convenient JdoDaoSupport base class
      that provides the get/setEntityManagerFactory and getJpaTemplate to be
      used by subclases:</para>

      <para><programlisting>public class ProductDaoImpl extends JpaDaoSupport implements ProductDao {
  
    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) throws DataAccessException {
        return getJpaTemplate().find("from Product");
    }
}</programlisting></para>

      <para>Besides working with Spring's JpaTemplate, one can also code
      Spring-based DAOs against the JPA, explicitly handling EntityManagers.
      As elaborated in teh corresponsing Hibernate section, the main advantage
      of this approach is that that your data access code is able to throw
      checked exceptions. JpaDaoSupport offers a variety of support methods
      for this scenario, for retrieving and releasing a transaction
      EntityManager, as well as for converting exceptions.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Implementing DAOs based on plain JPA</title>

      <para>It is possible to write code against the plain JPA without using
      any Spring dependencies, directly using an injected
      <literal>EntityManagerFactory</literal>. A corresponding DAO
      implementation might look like this:</para>

      <para><programlisting>public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory;

    public void setEntityManagerFactory(entityManagerFactory emf) {
        this.entityManagerFactory = emf;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
        EntityManager em = this.entityManagerFactory.getEntityManager();
        try {
             Query query = em.createQuery("from Product");
             return result = query.execute(category);
        }
        finally {
        if (em != null)
          em.close();
        }
    }
}</programlisting>The DAO above, still follows the Dependency Injection
      pattern and still fits nicely into a Spring application context, just
      like it would if coded against Spring's <literal>JpaTemplate</literal>:
      </para>

      <para><programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="entityManagerFactory" ref="myEMF"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting></para>

      <para>The main issue with such DAOs is that it always gets a new
      PersistenceManager from the factory. In order to access a Spring-managed
      transactional EntityManager (aware of the ongoing transation), consider
      using SharedEntityManagerCreator. The main advantage of this DAO style
      is that it depends on JPA API only; no import of any Spring class is
      required. This is of course appealing from a non-invasiveness
      perspective, and might feel more natural to JPA developers. However, the
      DAO throws plain JPAException (which is unchecked, so does not have to
      be declared or caught), which means that callers can only treat
      exceptions as generally fatal - unless they want to depend on JPA's own
      exception structure. Catching specific causes such as an optimistic
      locking failure is not possible without tying the caller to the
      implementation strategy. This tradeoff might be acceptable to
      applications that are strongly JPA-based and/or do not need any special
      exception treatment. In summary: DAOs can be implemented based on plain
      JPA API, while still being able to participate in Spring-managed
      transactions. This might in particular appeal to people already familar
      with JPA, feeling more natural to them. However, such DAOs will throw
      plain JPAException; conversion to Spring's DataAccessException would
      have to happen explicitly (if desired).</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Transaction Management</title>

      <para>To execute service operations within transactions, you can use
      Spring's common declarative transaction facilities. For example, you
      could define a <literal>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</literal> for a
      ProductService, which in turn delegates to the JPA-based ProductDao.
      Each specified method would then automatically get executed within a
      transaction, with all affected DAO operations automatically
      participating in it.</para>

      <para><programlisting>&lt;beans&gt;
  ...

  &lt;bean id="myTxManager" class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager"&gt;
    &lt;property name="entityManagerFactory" ref="myEmf"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductServiceTarget" class="product.ProductServiceImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="productDao" ref="myProductDao"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductService"
      class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean"&gt;
    &lt;property name="transactionManager" ref="myTxManager"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="target" ref="myProductServiceTarget"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="transactionAttributes"&gt;
      &lt;props&gt;
        &lt;prop key="increasePrice*"&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED&lt;/prop&gt;
        &lt;prop key="someOtherBusinessMethod"&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW&lt;/prop&gt;
        &lt;prop key="*"&gt;PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS,readOnly&lt;/prop&gt;
      &lt;/props&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting> Spring JPA allows
      <literal>JpaTransactionManager</literal> to expose a JPA transaction to
      JDBC access code that accesses the same JDBC
      <literal>DataSource</literal>, provided that the registered
      <literal>JpaDialect</literal> supports retrieval of the underlying JDBC
      <literal>Connection</literal>. Out of the box, Spring provides dialects
      for Hibernate, Toplink and Kodo JPA implementations. See next section
      for details on the <literal>JpaDialect</literal> mechanism.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>JpaDialect</title>

      <para>As an advanced feature <literal>JpaTemplate</literal>,
      <literal>JpaTransactionManager</literal> and subclasses of
      <literal>AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean</literal> support a custom
      <literal>JpaDialect</literal>, to be passed into the "jpaDialect" bean
      property. In such a scenario, the DAOs won't receive a
      <literal>EntityManagerFactory</literal> reference but rather a full
      <literal>JpaTemplate</literal> instance instead (for example, passed
      into <literal>JpaDaoSupport</literal>'s "jpaTemplate" property). A
      <literal>JpaDialect</literal> implementation can enable some advanced
      features supported by Spring, usually in a vendor-specific
      manner:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>applying specific transaction semantics (such as custom
          isolation level or transaction timeout)</para>

          Spring <literal>DataAccessExceptions</literal></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This is particularly valuable for special transaction semantics
      and for advanced translation of exception. Note that the default
      implementation used (<literal>DefaultJpaDialect</literal>) doesn't
      provide any special capabilities and if the above features are required,
      the approapriate dialect has to be specified.</para>

      its operations and how they are used within Spring's JPA support.</para>
