    <para><authorinitials>Source-level metadata</authorinitials> is the
    addition of <emphasis>attributes</emphasis> or <emphasis>annotations</emphasis>
    to program elements: usually, classes and/or methods.</para>

    <para>For example, we might add metadata to a class as follows:</para>

    <para><programlisting>/**
 * Normal comments
 * @@org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.DefaultTransactionAttribute()
 */
public class PetStoreImpl implements PetStoreFacade, OrderService {</programlisting></para>

    <para>We could add metadata to a method as follows:</para>

    <para><programlisting>/**
 * Normal comments
 * @@org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.RuleBasedTransactionAttribute ()
 * @@org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.RollbackRuleAttribute (Exception.class)
 * @@org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.NoRollbackRuleAttribute (&#34;ServletException&#34;)

public void echoException(Exception ex) throws Exception {
    ....
}</programlisting></para>

    <para>Both these examples use Jakarta Commons Attributes syntax.</para>

    <para>Source-level metadata was introduced to the mainstream with the
    release of Microsoft&#39;s .NET platform, which uses source-level
    attributes to control transactions, pooling and other behaviour.</para>

    <para>The value in this approach has been recognized in the J2EE
    community. For example, it&#39;s much less verbose than the traditional
    XML deployment descriptors exclusively used by EJB. While it is desirable
    to externalize some things from program source code, some important
    enterprise settings--notably transaction characteristics--belong in
    program source. Contrary to the assumptions of the EJB spec, it seldom
    makes sense to modify the transactional characteristics of a method.</para>

    <para>Although metadata attributes are typically used mainly by framework
    infrastructure to describe the services application classes require, it
    should also be possible for metadata attributes to be queried at runtime.
    This is a key distinction from solutions such as XDoclet, which primarily
    view metadata as a way of generating code such as EJB artefacts.</para>

    <para>There are a number of solutions in this space, including:</para>

    <title>Spring&#39;s metadata support</title>

    <para>In keeping with its provision of abstractions over important
    concepts, Spring provides a facade to metadata implementations, in the
    form of the <literal>org.springframework.metadata.Attributes</literal>
    interface.</para>

    <para>Such a facade adds value for several reasons:<itemizedlist><listitem><para>There
    is currently no standard metadata solution. Java 1.5 will provide one, but
    it is still in beta as of Spring 1.0. Furthermore, there will be a need
    for metadata support in 1.3 and 1.4 applications for at least two years.
    Spring aims to provide working solutions <emphasis>now</emphasis>; waiting
    for 1.5 is not an option in such an important area.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Current
    metadata APIs, such as Commons Attributes (used by Spring 1.0) are hard to
    test. Spring provides a simple metadata interface that is much easier to
    mock.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Even when Java 1.5 provides
    metadata support at language level, there will still be value in providing
    such an abstraction:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>JSR-175 metadata
    is static. It is associated with a class at compile time, and cannot be
    changed in a deployed environment. There is a need for hierarchical
    metadata, providing the ability to override certain attribute values in
    deployment--for example, in an XML file.</para></listitem><listitem><para>JSR-175
    metadata is returned through the Java reflection API. This makes it
    impossible to mock during test time. Spring provides a simple interface to
    allow this.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></listitem></itemizedlist></para>

    <para>Thus Spring will support JSR-175 before Java 1.5 reaches GA, but
    will continue to offer an attribute abstraction API.</para>

    <para>The Spring <literal>Attributes</literal> interface looks like this:</para>

    <para><programlisting>public interface Attributes {

    Collection getAttributes(Class targetClass);

    Collection getAttributes(Class targetClass, Class filter);

    Collection getAttributes(Method targetMethod);

    Collection getAttributes(Method targetMethod, Class filter);

    Collection getAttributes(Field targetField);

    Collection getAttributes(Field targetField, Class filter);
}</programlisting></para>

    <para>This is a lowest common denominator interface. JSR-175 offers more
    capabilities than this, such as attributes on method arguments. As of
    Spring 1.0, Spring aims to provide the subset of metadata required to
    provide effective declarative enterprise services a la EJB or .NET. Beyond
    Spring 1.0, it is likely that Spring will provide further metadata
    methods.</para>

    <para>Note that this interface offers <literal>Object</literal>
    attributes, like .NET. This distinguishes it from attribute systems such
    as that of Nanning Aspects and JBoss 4 (as of DR2), which offer only
    <literal>String</literal> attributes. There is a significant advantage in
    supporting <literal>Object</literal> attributes. It enables attributes to
    participate in class hierarchies and enables attributes to react
    intelligently to their configuration parameters.</para>

    <para>In most attribute providers, attribute classes will be configured
    via constructor arguments or JavaBean properties. Commons Attributes
    supports both.</para>

    <para>As with all Spring abstraction APIs, <literal>Attributes</literal>
    is an interface. This makes it easy to mock attribute implementations for
    unit tests.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="metadata-commons">
    <title>Integration with Jakarta Commons Attributes</title>

    <para>Presently Spring supports only Jakarta Commons Attributes out of the
    box, although it is easy to provide implementations of the
    <literal>org.springframework.metadata.Attributes</literal> interface for
    other metadata providers.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Commons Attributes 2.0</emphasis> (<link
    linkend="???">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/attributes/</link>)
    is a capable attributes solution. It supports attribute configuration via
    constructor arguments and JavaBean properties, which offers better
    self-documentation in attribute definitions. (Support for JavaBean
    properties was added at the request of the Spring team.)</para>

    <para>We&#39;ve already seen two examples of Commons Attributes attributes
    definitions. In general, we will need to express:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>The name of the attribute class</emphasis>. This can
        be an FQN, as shown above. If the relevant attribute class has already
        been imported, the FQN isn&#39;t required. It&#39;s also possible to
        specify &#34;attribute packages&#34; in attribute compiler
        configuration.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Any necessary parameterization,</emphasis> via
        constructor arguments or JavaBean properties</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Bean properties look as follows:</para>

    <para><programlisting>/**
 * @@MyAttribute(myBooleanJavaBeanProperty=true)
 */</programlisting></para>

    <para>It&#39;s possible to combine constructor arguments and JavaBean
    properties (as in Spring IoC).</para>

    <para>Because, unlike Java 1.5 attributes, Commons Attributes is not
    integrated with the Java language, it is necessary to run a special
    <emphasis>attribute compilation</emphasis> step as part of the build
    process.</para>

    <para>To run Commons Attributes as part of the build process, you will
    need to do the following.</para>

    <para>1. Copy the necessary library Jars to <literal>$ANT_HOME/lib</literal>.
    Four Jars are required, and all are distributed with Spring:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Commons Attributes compiler Jar and API Jar</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>xjavadoc.jar, from XDoclet</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>commons-collections.jar, from Jakarta Commons</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>2. Import the Commons Attributes ant tasks into your project build
    script, as follows:</para>

    <programlisting>&#60;taskdef resource=&#34;org/apache/commons/attributes/anttasks.properties&#34;/&#62;</programlisting>

    <para>3. Next, define an attribute compilation task, which will use the
    Commons Attributes attribute-compiler task to &#34;compile&#34; the
    attributes in the source. This process results in the generation of
    additional sources, to a location specified by the destdir attribute. Here
    we show the use of a temporary directory:</para>

    <para><programlisting>&#60;target name=&#34;compileAttributes&#34; &#62;

    &#60;attribute-compiler 
        destdir=&#34;${commons.attributes.tempdir}&#34; 
    &#62;
        &#60;fileset dir=&#34;${src.dir}&#34; includes=&#34;**/*.java&#34;/&#62;
    &#60;/attribute-compiler&#62;

&#60;/target&#62;</programlisting></para>

    <para>The compile target that runs Javac over the sources should depend on
    this attribute compilation task, and must also compile the generated
    sources, which we output to our destination temporary directory. If there
    are syntax errors in your attribute definitions, they will normally be
    caught by the attribute compiler. However, if the attribute definitions
    are syntactically plausible, but specify invalid types or class names, the
    compilation of the generated attribute classes may fail. In this case, you
    can look at the generated classes to establish the cause of the problem.</para>

    <remark>Commons Attributes also provides Maven support. Please refer to
    Commons Attributes documentation for further information.</remark>

    <para>While this attribute compilation process may look complex, in fact
    it&#39;s a one-off cost. Once set up, attribute compilation is
    incremental, so it doesn&#39;t usually noticeably slow the build process.
    And once the compilation process is set up, you may find that use of
    attributes as described in this chapter can save you a lot of time in
    other areas. </para>

    <para>If you require attribute indexing support (only currently required
    by Spring for attribute-targeted web controllers, discussed below), you
    will need an additional step, which must be performed on a Jar file of
    your compiled classes. In this, optional, step, Commons Attributes will
    create an index of all the attributes defined on your sources, for
    efficient lookup at runtime. This step looks as follows:</para>

    <para><programlisting>&#60;attribute-indexer jarFile=&#34;myCompiledSources.jar&#34;&#62;
    
    &#60;classpath refid=&#34;master-classpath&#34;/&#62;

&#60;/attribute-indexer&#62;</programlisting></para>

    <remark>See the /attributes directory of the Spring jPetStore sample
    application for an example of this build process. You can take the build
    script it contains and modify it for your own projects.</remark>

    <para>If your unit tests depend on attributes, try to express the
    dependency on the Spring Attributes abstraction, rather than Commons
    Attributes. Not only is this more portable--for example, your tests will
    still work if you switch to Java 1.5 attributes in future--it simplifies
    testing. Commons Attributes is a static API, while Spring provides a
    metadata interface that you can easily mock.</para>

  <sect1 id="metadata-uses">
    <title>Metadata and Spring AOP autoproxying</title>

    <para>The most important uses of metadata attributes are in conjunction
    with Spring AOP. This provides a .NET-like programming model, where
    declarative services are automatically provided to application objects
    that declare metadata attributes. Such metadata attributes can be
    supported out of the box by the framework, as in the case of declarative
    transaction management, or can be custom.</para>

    <para>There is widely held to be a synergy between AOP and metadata
    attributes.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Fundamentals</title>

      <para>This builds on the Spring AOP autoproxy functionality.
      Configuration might look like this:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&#60;bean id=&#34;autoproxy&#34; 
    class=&#34;org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator&#34;&#62;

/&#62;</programlisting></para>

      <para>The basic concepts here should be familiar from the discussion of
      autoproxying in the AOP chapter. </para>

      <para>The most important bean definitions are those named <emphasis
      role="bold">autoproxy</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">transactionAdvisor</emphasis>.
      Note that the actual bean names are not important; what matters is their
      class.</para>

      <para>The autoproxy bean definition of class <literal>org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator</literal>
      will automatically advise (&#34;autoproxy&#34;) all bean instances in
      the current factory based on matching Advisor implementations. This
      class knows nothing about attributes, but relies on Advisors&#39;
      pointcuts matching. The pointcuts do know about attributes.</para>

      <para>Thus we simply need an AOP advisor that will provide declarative
      transaction management based on attributes.</para>

      <para>It&#39;s possible to add arbitrary custom Advisor implementations
      as well, and they will also be evaluated and applied automatically. (You
      can use Advisors whose pointcuts match on criteria besides attributes in
      the same autoproxy configuration, if necessary.)</para>

      <para>Finally, the <literal>attributes</literal> bean is the Commons
      Attributes Attributes implementation. Replace with another
      implementation of <literal>org.springframework.metadata.Attributes
      </literal>to source attributes from a different source.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="metadata-tx">
      <title>Declarative transaction management</title>

      <para>The commonest use of source-level attributes it to provide
      declarative transaction management a la .NET. Once the bean definitions
      shown above are in place, you can define any number of application
      objects requiring declarative transactions. Only those classes or
      methods with transaction attributes will be given transaction advice.
      You need to do nothing except define the required transaction
      attributes.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Unlike</emphasis> in .NET, you can specify transaction
      attributes at either class or method level. Class-level attributes, if
      specified, will be &#34;inherited&#34; by all methods. Method attributes
      will wholly override any class-level attributes.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="metadata-pool">
      <title>Pooling</title>

      <para>Again, as with .NET, you can enable pooling behaviour via
      class-level attributes. Spring can apply this behaviour to any POJO. You
      simply need to specify a pooling attribute, as follows, in the business
      object to be pooled:</para>

public class MyClass {</programlisting>You&#39;ll need the usual autoproxy
      infrastructure configuration. You then need to specify a pooling
      <literal>TargetSourceCreator</literal>, as follows. Because pooling
      affects the creation of the target, we can&#39;t use a regular advice.
      Note that pooling will apply even if there are no advisors applicable to
      the class, if that class has a pooling attribute.</para>

      <para><programlisting>&#60;bean id=&#34;poolingTargetSourceCreator&#34;

    autowire=&#34;constructor&#34; &#62;
&#60;/bean&#62;</programlisting></para>

      <para>The relevant autoproxy bean definition needs to specify a list of
      &#34;custom target source creators&#34;, including the Pooling target
      source creator. We could modify the example shown above to include this
      property as follows:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&#60;bean id=&#34;autoproxy&#34;

    &#60;/property&#62;
&#60;/bean&#62;</programlisting></para>

      <para>As with the use of metadata in Spring in general, this is a
      one-off cost: once setup is out of the way, it&#39;s very easy to use
      pooling for additional business objects. </para>

      <remark>It&#39;s arguable that the need for pooling is rare, so
      there&#39;s seldom a need to apply pooling to a large number of business
      objects. Hence this feature does not appear to be used often.</remark>

      <para>Please see the Javadoc for the <literal>org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy</literal>
      package for more details. It&#39;s possible to use a different pooling
      implementation than Commons Pool with minimal custom coding.</para>

      <para>We can define custom attributes, to provide any kind of

    <title>Using attributes to minimize MVC web tier configuration</title>

    <para>The other main use of Spring metadata as of 1.0 is to provide an
    option to simplify Spring MVC web configuration.</para>

    <para>Spring MVC offers flexible <emphasis>handler mappings</emphasis>:
    mappings from incoming request to controller (or other handler) instance.
    Normally handler mappings are configured in the <literal>xxxx-servlet.xml</literal>
    file for the relevant Spring DispatcherServlet.</para>

    <para>Holding these mappings in the DispatcherServlet configuration file
    is normally A Good Thing. It provides maximum flexibility. In particular:<itemizedlist><listitem><para>The
    controller instance is explicitly managed by Spring IoC, through an XML
    bean definition</para></listitem><listitem><para>The mapping is external
    to the controller, so the same controller instance could be given multiple
    mappings in the same DispatcherServlet context or reused in a different
    configuration.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Spring MVC is able to
    support mappings based on any criteria, rather than merely the request
    URL-to-controller mappings available in most other frameworks.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para>

    <para>However, this does mean that for each controller we typically need
    both a handler mapping (normally in a handler mapping XML bean definition)
    and an XML mapping for the controller itself.</para>

    <para>Spring offers a simpler approach based on source-level attributes,
    which is an attractive option in simpler scenarios.</para>

    <remark>The approach described in this section is best suited to
    relatively simple MVC scenarios. It sacrifices some of the power of Spring
    MVC, such as the ability to use the same controller with different
    mappings, and the ability to base mappings on something other than request
    URL.</remark>

    <para>In this approach, controllers are marked with one or more
    class-level metadata attributes, each specifying one URL they should be
    mapped to.</para>

    <para>The following examples show the approach. In each case, we have a
    controller that depends on a business object of type Cruncher. As usual,
    this dependency will be resolved by Dependency Injection. The Cruncher
    must be available through a bean definition in the relevant
    DispatcherServlet XML file, or a parent context.</para>

    <para>We attach an attribute to the controller class specifying the URL
    that should map to it. We can express the dependency through a JavaBean
    property or a constructor argument. This dependency must be resolvable by
    autowiring: that is, there must be exactly one business object of type
    Cruncher available in the context.</para>

    <para>For this automapping to work, we need to add the following to the
    relevant <literal>xxxx-servlet.xml</literal> file, specifying the
    attributes handler mapping. This special handler mapping can handle any
    number of controllers with attributes as shown above. The bean id
    (&#34;commonsAttributesHandlerMapping&#34;) is not important. The type is
    what matters:</para>

    <para>We <emphasis>do not </emphasis>currently need an Attributes bean
    definition, as in the above example, because this class works directly
    with the Commons Attributes API, not via the Spring metadata abstraction.</para>

    <para>We now need no XML configuration for each controller. Controllers
    are automatically mapped to the specified URL(s). Controllers benefit from
    IoC, using Spring&#39;s autowiring capability. For example, the dependency
    expressed in the &#34;cruncher&#34; bean property of the simple controller
    shown above is automatically resolved in the current web application
    context. Both Setter and Constructor Dependency Injection are available,
    each with zero configuration.</para>

    <para>This approach has the following benefits:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Significantly reduced volume of configuration. Each time we add
        a controller we need add <emphasis>no</emphasis> XML configuration. As
        with attribute-driven transaction management, once the basic
        infrastructure is in place, it is very easy to add more application
        classes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>We retain much of the power of Spring IoC to configure
        controllers.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>This approach has the following limitations:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>One-off cost in more complex build process. We need an attribute
        compilation step and an attribute indexing step. However, once in
        place, this should not be an issue.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Currently Commons Attributes only, although support for other
        attribute providers may be added in future.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Only &#34;autowiring by type&#34; dependency injection is
        supported for such controllers. However, this still leaves them far in
        advance of Struts Actions (with no IoC support from the framework)
        and, arguably, WebWork Actions (with only rudimentary IoC support)
        where IoC is concerned.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Reliance on automagical IoC resolution may be confusing.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Because autowiring by type means there must be exactly one
    dependency of the specified type, we need to be careful if we use AOP. In
    the common case using TransactionProxyFactoryBean, for example, we end up
    with <emphasis>two</emphasis> implementations of a business interface such
    as Cruncher: the original POJO definition, and the transactional AOP
    proxy. This won&#39;t work, as the owning application context can&#39;t
    resolve the type dependency unambiguously. The solution is to use AOP
    autoproxying, setting up the autoproxy infrastructure so that there is
    only one implementation of Cruncher defined, and that implementation is
    automatically advised. Thus this approach works well with
    attribute-targeted declarative services as described above. As the
    attributes compilation process must be in place to handle the web
    controller targeting, this is easy to set up.</para>

    <para>Unlike other metadata functionality, there is currently only a
    Commons Attributes implementation available:
    org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.metadata.CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping.
    This limitation is due to the fact that not only do we need attribute
    compilation, we need attribute <emphasis>indexing</emphasis>: the ability
    to ask the attributes API for all classes with the PathMap attribute.
    Indexing is not currently offered on the <literal>org.springframework.metadata.Attributes</literal>
    abstraction interface, although it may be in future. (If you want to add
    support for another attributes implementation--which must support
    indexing--you can easily extend the <literal>AbstractPathMapHandlerMapping</literal>
    superclass of <literal>CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping</literal>,
    implementing the two protected abstract methods to use your preferred
    attributes API.)</para>

    <para>Thus we need two additional steps in the build process: attribute
    compilation and attribute indexing. Use of the attribute indexer task was
    shown above. Note that Commons Attributes presently requires a Jar file as
    input to indexing.</para>

    <remark>If you begin with a handler metadata mapping approach, it is
    possible to switch at any point to a classic Spring XML mapping approach.
    So you don&#39;t close off this option. For this reason, I find that I
    often start a web application using metadata mapping.</remark>

    <title>Other uses of metadata attributes</title>

    <para>Other uses of metadata attributes appear to be growing in
    popularity. As of March 2004, an attribute-based validation package for
    Spring is in development. The one-off setup cost of attribute parsing
    looks more attractive, when the potential for multiple uses is considered.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Adding support for additional metadata APIs</title>

    <para>Should you wish to provide support for another metadata API it is
    easy to do so.</para>

    <para>Simply implement the <literal>org.springframework.metadata.Attributes</literal>
    interface as a facade for your metadata API. You can then include this
    object in your bean definitions as shown above.</para>

    <para>All framework services that use metadata, such as AOP
    metadata-driven autoproxying, will then automatically be able to use your
    new metadata provider.</para>

    <remark>We expect to add support for Java 1.5 attributes--probably as an
    add-on to the Spring core--in Q2 2004.</remark>
